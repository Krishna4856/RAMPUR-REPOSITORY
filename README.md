IN OTHER PART FOR MAKING THE FROSTING
  1. Set the butter and cream cheese on the counter to warm to room temperature. You'll be whipping the butter and cream cheese up, but that only works if it is soft enough to whip! Set the two dairy products out for 15-30 minutes to get soft.
  
  In a pinch, you can gently microwave them to speed things up, but keep it very brief. You don't want liquid.
  
  
  2. Combine butter and cream cheese. An electric mixer is best, as it will make quick work of the dairies, but a wooden spoon and whisk work well too. They don't have to be perfectly combined, just well mixed.
  
  
  3. Add powdered sugar slowly, keeping the mixing going throughout. Powdered sugar will want to poof and fly out as you mix it.
    
     To avoid a mess, add it in 3-4 parts, mixing almost all of the first part in before adding the second.
  
  
  4. Add vanilla and whip until creamy. Keep the mixer (or your mixing hand) going until the frosting is nice smooth texture. If you want to thin it out a bit so it spreads better, add 2 tablespoons of cold milk.
 
 
  5. Cut the cake into layers and frost. Place a little pat of icing on the bottom of our plate or cake dish to keep the bottom layer from sliding around.[10] Then frost it and stack another layer on top, frosting the top of that. 
  
  Don't worry too much about the sides yet.Do not try to frost the cake while it is still hot. Let it cool completely.
  
  6. Assemble the layers and continue frosting. Stack the layers up high, frosting between each layer with a 1/4" of frosting or so, adding more to taste.
  
  
  7. Frost the cake and enjoy! For bakery quality frosting, keep the knife clean after every pass, using a little warm water to ensure your frosting knife applies the icing smoothly and evenly. Use big globs of icing at a time and don't try to spread it too thin. By working in small areas, not spreading too thin, and cleaning the knife regularly, you can get a quality frosted cake.

  If you've got time, real pros will "double frost." Start with a thin layer of frosting everywhere -- it is okay if it pulls up crumbs. Then freeze the cake for 15 minutes, pull it out, and frost "for real." You'll be astonished how easily it goes on!
