Making Cake
 1. Gather and measure out all of the ingredients. Good bakers know that moving quickly and efficiently in the kitchen leads 
    to better cakes and smaller messes. Measuring out ahead of time makes it possible.
 
 2. Cream shortening and gradually add in sugar. Use an electric mixer set to medium speed. Add the sugar along the edges and
    slowly work it in to avoid sugar splatter.
 
 3. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg is added. Mix in well, keeping your beater moving. It is okay if you 
    add them both at once, too.
 4. Make a paste out of the cocoa and food coloring, then add to cream. In a separate bowl, use a whisk to blend the food 
    coloring into the cocoa.
 
Fun Fact: The original red velvet cakes got their color because imported cocoa was actually red tinted. The food coloring came later.
 
 5. Add salt, flour, baking soda, vanilla, and buttermilk, beating well after each ingredient is added. You can also mix the 
 flour, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl, adding at once. You can also add it all together into the batter one at a 
 time, using the electric mixer to get a nice consistent batter.Add the flour slowly to avoid splatter. It can help to add 
 it with the buttermilk.
 
 6. Pour vinegar over the batter. Just a splash is all you need -- it will give it a nice subtle tanginess.
 
 7. Stir until well mixed. You want a thin, consistent batter with not chunks of flour or dry ingredients left.
    Want a little more red color? Add a few more drops of red food coloring.
 
 8. Pour the cake in a large cake pan or 2 layer cake pans and bake in a 350ÂºF. The cake should take roughly an 
    hour to cook. When it is done, you'll know through the toothpick test -- stab the center of the cake with a knife 
    or skewer-- if it comes out without still-wet batter on it, it's done.
 
 9. Wait about 20 minutes to cool before frosting. After 5 minutes, remove from the pan and let cool on a wire rack.
    Don't frost a hot cake -- the warmth with thin out the frosting and make it difficult, if not impossible, to add smoothly.
